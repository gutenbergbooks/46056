<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Province of Quebec covers an area of
over one hundred thousand square miles, and is
the largest province in all the Dominion of
Canada. The latter country is sometimes called
British North America, but this particular province
is very French indeed.</p>

<p>The persistency of French nationality in
Canada is remarkable. The formal guarantees
of the Treaty of Paris and the Quebec Act,
that language, religion, and laws should be preserved,
undoubtedly has saved Quebec from
extinction by conquest.</p>

<p>This great province is bounded on the north
by Labrador and the Gulf of the St. Lawrence,
and on the south by New Brunswick and the
States of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont
and New York.</p>

<p>The great St. Lawrence river flows through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
its entire length, and is navigable for ships as
far as the city of Quebec; while great ocean-going
liners come from the Old World and up
this river as far as the city of Quebec, and those
of not more than five thousand tons continue up
the river as far as Montreal. This latter city
is Canada's largest and most important settlement.</p>

<p>The city of Quebec is the capital of the province
from which it derives its name, and once,
long years ago, it was the capital of all Canada,
and is still known as "The ancient capital."</p>

<p>It is certainly a very picturesque part of the
New World, and not the least interesting are
the French Canadian people, descendent of the
early voyageurs who came to this corner of the
globe as early as the year 1535 <small>A. D.</small> One still
finds in lower Canada the same spirit that kept
up the fight for the Fleur de lis long after
the "few acres of snow" had been abandoned
by the French King, Louis Fourteenth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>AN INTRODUCTION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> traveler who comes to visit on the island
of Montreal gets no correct idea of the beauty
of it all until he has climbed to the top of
Mount Royal, which rises directly behind the
great city of Montreal in the Province of
Quebec. From this elevation, about one thousand
feet above sea level, the observer beholds
not only the banks of the St. Lawrence river,
with its warehouses, grain elevators and
shipping; he sees not only this solidly built city
of churches&mdash;but far to his left stretches the
farming country of the Province of Quebec,
far to his right, on clear days he can see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Adirondack Mountains and Lake Champlain,
while on the opposite shores of the St. Lawrence,
spanned by the once famous Victoria
Bridge, he sees the villages of Longueil and St.
Lambert.</p>

<p>Then, from the very summit of this mountain,
he must also look behind him and see the
numerous small towns and villages that lie back
of Mount Royal, all of these being reached by
tramways which run out from Montreal.</p>

<p>The largest of these settlements are known,
one as Outremont, the other as Cote-des-Neiges;
translated into English these would be known as
"behind the mountain" and "hill of snow."</p>

<p>It was in the latter village of Cote-des-Neiges
that little Oisette Mary Tremblent, our little
Canadian, or, rather, our little Quebec cousin,
was born. The French Canadian child is the
product of five generations of French people
whose ancestors came from France with Champlain
and Jacques Cartier, and who, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
British won Canada from France, were allowed
by the British to keep their own tongue, their
own religion and their own flag.</p>

<p>Let me introduce Oisette Mary Tremblent,
our little Quebec cousin, to you. Behold, then,
a very plump little girl, with skin the color of
saffron tea and a nose as flat as flat can be.
There never were such bead-like eyes, nor such
black shiny hair as hers.</p>

<p>She usually wore a black and red checked
dress of worsted, with bright blue collar and
cuffs, and around her neck was a purple ribbon,
on which was hung a silver medal. On this
medal was stamped the figure of the Blessed
Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Oisette Mary's people
loved gay colors.</p>

<p>She was a very happy little girl from the
time she slipped out of bed in the morning,
always awakened by the neighboring church
bell of the parish ringing its three strokes&mdash;"Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Son and Holy Ghost." When she
heard this bell, Oisette bowed her little head
three times and made the sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>Her day was thirteen hours long and she
knew no naps! Small wonder that she fell
asleep the moment her head touched the pillows,
and she heard nothing of the violin playing,
the singing and sometimes dancing that
went on in the rooms below stairs.</p>

<p>Oisette Mary had two older sisters away at
a convent school, two older brothers, one already
studying for the priesthood, and one
small baby brother, who spent long hours on
the cottage floor with "Carleau" the dog, for
company.</p>

<p>A family of six children! What a large
family you think? Not at all! French Canadian
families frequently number twelve or
more, and less than ten children is counted as
a small household.</p>

<p>Monsieur Tremblent, Oisette's father, owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a large and valuable melon patch. You know
Montreal melon is famous the world over; and
on fine days in August one could see Monsieur
Tremblent walking slowly along, counting his
melons as they grew.</p>

<p>"Un, deux, trois, quatre," he would murmur.
In his wake little Oisette would follow, gay little
parrot that she was, also repeating after him.
"Cinque, six, sept, huit." In this way she
had learned to count.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the tenth melon was
a large fine one, and, when Oisette beheld it,
she sat right down beside it, put her two little
arms around it and murmured: "C'est pour
Monsieur, le Curé," which translated into English
reads: "This is for the priest." Her
father chuckled and said to Louis, her brother,
who was weeding hard by, "She is just like
her mother, the little one, she always remembers
the priest."</p>

<p>Madame Tremblent was diminutive in stature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
her two interests in life were her home and
her church; she understood the English language
as she heard it spoken, but she had never attempted
to utter a word in English herself,
nor could she read a line of anything but French.</p>

<p>Her husband wore a silk hat and frock coat
on Sundays and Holy Days, he attended political
meetings and was a keen politician, could address
a meeting in either tongue, as can most
young Canadian Frenchmen; but Madame apparently
took no interest other than to see that
her husband's coat was well brushed, his silk
hat very glossy indeed.</p>

<p>She consulted her priest when anything worried
her, she had so little faith in banks that
she always carried her house-keeping money
either in her stocking or in her petticoat pockets.</p>

<p>There came a day in early September when
quantities of melons were gathered for the market,
put in the big farm wagon, and Oisette
was allowed to sit by her father on the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
seat as they drove to the Bonsecour Market in
Montreal. The start was made in the early
morning. Oisette sang to herself as they
rumbled along.</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Alouette, gentille Alouette, Alouette, Je te plumerai,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Je te plumerai la tête, Je te plumerai la tête,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O Alouette, gentille Alouette, Alouette, Je te plumerai."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>The French Canadian is apt to sing when
he is very happy, and Oisette was especially
happy to-day, for she knew that that tenth
melon, or one very like it, had been left in the
front vestibule of her home, ready to be sent
to the priest's home later in the day.</p>

<p>There is one quality that the French Canadian
child has, which is not always to be found in
children of every nationality: namely, obedience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
One seldom finds a naughty or willful
little French boy or girl. They are stolid perhaps
and placid, but there is no kicking or
screaming.</p>

<p>On this particular September morning,
Oisette, when the Bonsecour Market was finally
reached, waited patiently for her father, she
sat on the high seat now by herself. The
team, along with many others, was lined up
beside the market. From this perch she could
see the beautiful river, the boats coming in
and leaving the harbor; she could see the
wharves and the loading and unloading of great
steamers. It was all very fascinating.</p>

<p>Then back of her was the great market, all
the stalls were piled high with fruit and vegetables
of every size and shape in a riot of
color.</p>

<p>Along the pavement were coops of live
chickens and turkeys. There were long
pouches of "black pudding," dangling from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
booths. The stalls were heaped with home
grown tobacco, dark slabs of maple sugar, home
woven toweling, curtains, rugs, carpets, firmly
knit socks, elaborately plaited mats. A charm
and a glamor hangs over the generally commonplace
business of buying and selling, getting
gain, and making provision for the needs of
the day. The whole thing is like a gay picture
book. There are groups of <i>habitant</i> women,
all talking in chorus; the queer little blue and
red carts that have come from across the river
by ferry; the small pink pigs squealing their
hardest as they are lifted from the crates of
the vendors to the sacks of the purchasers;
the squawking of fowls whose end is near.
Certainly Bonsecour Market is a spot to be
visited if one would see the <i>Habitant</i> in his
happiest mood.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the customers arrive.
There are lovely ladies in limousines, and sometimes
there would hop out of a motor a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
little English Canadian girl, to buy some nuts
from open bags which always stand in rows
along the pavements.</p>

<p>One day a very lively little missie gave Oisette
a handful of English walnuts and invited her
to climb down and come inside the market
and see some little pigs.</p>

<p>But Oisette had been told to remain on
guard, and remain she did. Now and then
she would have a glimpse of her father as he
went from stall to stall disposing of his stock.</p>

<p>One of his best customers was an old Irish
dame, who had a French name because she
had married in her youth one Alphonse LeBlanc,
but she did not speak French at all.
She was very popular with the English customers,
and many of the "quality" (as she
called them), bought her fruit and vegetables
because she spoke their tongue. Her manners,
too, made her famous throughout the market.
As a customer arrived, she would make a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
curtsy, as though Royalty approached, and
would say in her rich brogue, "And what fer
yez, Darlin?"</p>

<p>One market day, when a cold slanting rain
came on, Madame LeBlanc insisted that Monsieur
Tremblent should lift little Oisette down
and bring her inside Madame's stall.</p>

<p>So she was made very cozy beside a diminutive
stove, known as a Quebec heater. It certainly
was a very warmth giving stove, with
a black iron kettle on the top, which poured
forth a long plume of white steam. On a shelf
hard by a big yellow and black cat purred
very loud, as though trying to beat the kettle.
He was flanked on each side by pyramids of
cheese.</p>

<p>In spite of wind and weather, customers arrived,
one and two at a time; they would step
inside one at a time, leaving just room enough
for Madame to curtsy. Most of them noticed
Oisette and asked Madame about her. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Monsieur Tremblent came back at last to call
for his little girl, he found she had made friends
with the cat and had her pockets full of latire
(molasses candy), and was holding a big red
apple. Small wonder that her face was
wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>When her father opened the door, Oisette
heard Madame say: "Come in, dear, shut
the door, and we'll have a cup of tay."</p>

<p>A cup of this strong brewing was prepared
for little Oisette as a matter of course&mdash;which
may explain why her complexion was so murky.</p>

<p>On this particular market day however, as
she sat beside her father, the fresh September
breeze gave her a very bright color, and her
eyes were shining with excitement. Several
lovely things had happened, all of which she
would remember to tell her mother about when
home was reached. First there was a band
of music leading some fine-looking soldier boys
along the road, and the tune was very catching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The boys were all singing "Over There"
as they swung along. Then, because some road
was closed for repairs, her father had driven
into town by a new route and she saw, for the
first time, a statue of the late King Edward
the Seventh, which she admired very much.
Then after the big market wagon rumbled down
a very steep long hill, she saw the monument
in <i>Place d'Armes</i> Square known as "The Landing
of Maisonneuve."</p>

<p>This was an old friend, but she was never
tired of looking at it, and knew all the figures
about the base. There was the fierce Iroquois
Indian crouching for his prey. There was the
huntsman with his gun and dog; there was the
sweet-faced nun, Jeanne Mance, who founded
the order of Black Nuns in Canada, and then,
atop of all, was the dashing French Cavalier
Maisonneuve in his plumed hat, corselet and
top boots. He was the founder of this great
city of Montreal in the year 1642.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>She was never tired of hearing the story of
those early days as her father told it to her.</p>

<p>How the brave voyageurs had come to a
land filled with hostile tribes of Indians. First
these adventurous Frenchmen settled in Quebec,
the city of Quebec was founded, and then
Paul de Comedy, Sire de Maisonneuve, being
anxious to follow up this great river St. Lawrence,
coaxed his men to row with him the one
hundred and sixty miles right against a swift
current until they came to Mount Royal and
beheld the swift rapids in the river; these are
now called Lachine Rapids. So they decided
to land and build another village.</p>

<p>One can read in Parkman's history a very
clear picture of that scene, just at twilight when
they stepped from their boats and tired as they
were, they stopped to build an altar and hold
a mass of thanksgiving to God for the safe
journey. For lights on that altar, they imprisoned
fireflies in bottles and the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
all knelt on the ground while the mass was said.
They were watched by hostile Iroquois Indians
who lurked in the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>All this was long long ago. There are no
more Indians wearing blankets nowadays. But
on this spot where mass was said rises the
great solid city of Montreal with its two nationalities,
French and English, trying to live
in harmony.</p>

<p>This statue stands in <i>Place d'Armes</i> Square,
just in front of the famous Notre Dame church,
with its twin towers, two hundred and twenty-seven
feet high. In these towers hang some
famous chimes. One bell of this chime weighs
twenty-four thousand seven hundred and eighty
pounds and is known as the Great Bourdon.
It takes seven men to ring it, and it has a deep
booming note that is heard for miles.</p>

<p>There is a legend about this corner of the
square where this church stands. It seems that
there is always a breeze blowing just here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
even the very hottest day in summer, and the
story goes that on this corner the Devil and
the Wind once met, and the wind as it swept
up from the river and swirled around the corner
said to the Devil: "I'll travel along with
you," and Satan replied, "Before we start, I
must go into this great church here and confess
my sins, so you wait around this corner
until I am done." And the wind said: "Very
well, I'll hang around." Now, when the Devil
got into the confessional, he had so many sins
to confess that he is still there, and the wind
still waits on that corner; waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>One day when Oisette Mary drove past that
street corner, the wind did sweep up through
the narrow street, from the river, swirl around
the corner and away went her hat rolling across
the square, driven by the summer breeze until
it was caught at the base of the Maisonneuve
monument and finally handed back to her by a
French boy. So she never forgot the legend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>TWO WONDERFUL EVENTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Saturday afternoon, in fact the very
next day after the market trip, Oisette's father
could have been seen walking through the village
street; he was carrying under his arm that
tenth melon, or one very like it, which his
daughter had selected for the Curé.</p>

<p>In his wake came our little Quebec cousin,
her red ribbons bobbing along. Carleau, the
dog, was at her heels, his short tail, as he
walked, moved like the rudder on a boat.</p>

<p>This village street, with its white plaster
houses and rows of poplar trees, was very
picturesque. There was a yellow sunlight
tipped over everything. Just as this little procession
crossed the dusty road to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rectory gate, a big motor came purring along.
In the tonneau were two ladies and a dear
little girl; the latter had flying yellow curls.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="two men and a girl" />
<div class="caption">"MR. SAGE .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. WAS WAVING A GREENBACK IN MONSIEUR TREMBLENT'S FACE"</div>
</div>

<p>"Pappa," she called, "see the big melon!"
Now pappa was at the wheel, driving his own
car. He was watching the road carefully; he
had fears lest the little French girl might suddenly
dart in front of the car; he had also observed
Carleau, but the melon was the one
thing in the foreground that he had missed;
and, strange to say, a melon was the very thing
these people had set out to find.</p>

<p>So, in the twinkling of an eye, the big car
was brought to a full stop and Mr. Sage, its
owner, was waving a greenback in Monsieur
Tremblent's face.</p>

<p>Mr. Sage was naturally a silent man, his
motto was "Money talks." Therefore he was
somewhat amazed that the owner of the melon
did not hand the fruit to him at once; and still
more surprised was he to see Oisette Mary give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one of her funny little bows and hear her say:
"Pardon Monsieur, c'est pour Monsieur le
Curé," and then she added in English "but
there are many more chez moi."</p>

<p>The ladies laughed in chorus and repeated,
"Many more at your house, then jump right
in and show us the way."</p>

<p>"More as good as that one, eh?" asked
Mr. Sage, as he opened the car door.</p>

<p>Monsieur Tremblent was dumb with surprise,
he had been inclined to accept the offer and
turn back to get another melon for the Curé,
but Oisette won the day by jumping into the
car. "I always have good luck," he told his
priest afterward, "when I take the little one."</p>

<p>Those people not only bought three melons,
but promised to come again.</p>

<p>When Oisette Mary was eight years of age
two very wonderful events occurred, which
events stood out in her memory for all time.</p>

<p>One was when she took her first communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the month of May, which all good Catholics
know as the month of Mary; and the second
was at the end of that same year, on Christmas
Eve, when she was allowed to attend the midnight
mass with her parents for the first time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="Girl kneeling below a madonna" />
<div class="caption">"BERNADETTE .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. LOOKED UP"</div>
</div>

<p>Little girls who take their first communion
are such a pretty sight, for they are all dressed
in white; white stockings, white slippers, dress
and veil and around their heads each one has
a wreath of white flowers.</p>

<p>The church service is always early in the
day. Oisette's communion was given at a picturesque
little church in the East End of Montreal.
This church is known as Notre Dame
de Lourdes. (Our Lady of Lourdes.) It is
a copy of the larger church at Lourdes, France,
and over the high altar is a representation of
a little girl kneeling before an image of the
Blessed Virgin Mary. Almost a century ago
there was a little girl in Lourdes, France, named
Bernadette, who being sent one morning very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
early to a grotto, by her parents, was told to
bring home a pitcher of spring water from
the clear spring that bubbled there, and the
legend was that when Bernadette knelt to catch
the water she looked up and saw, high on a
rock in the grotto, the figure of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, and the Virgin smiled at her
and told her that the water had a healing
power. Ever since that time many pilgrims
have visited Lourdes in France and been healed
by its waters.</p>

<p>Certainly the little church in Montreal has
a decided charm. Directly a visitor enters he
observes over the high altar the figure of little
Bernadette kneeling in her blue dress and white
cap and above her is the figure of the Virgin.
Lights above the Virgin's head are so arranged
that a most beautiful glow falls upon her face
and figure. Children all love this little church,
and it is a pretty sight to see them marching
through its portals two and two. The small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
boys look well in black suits, white collars and
white ribbons tied on the left arm. But they
get little attention, admiration all being centered
on the dainty little maidens about to make their
first communion.</p>

<p>When the service is over, these little communicants
wear their white garb all day long,
and go about visiting all their relatives and
friends until nightfall. At each household they
visit they expect a gift, sometimes it is a rosary
or a prayer book, or a locket, and sometimes
it is money put in the shoe for luck.</p>

<p>Oisette's day ended with a drive out to Bord
a Plouffe, near the end of the Island of Montreal,
where the Sacred Heart Convent is to
be found. Here she visited her two older sisters
who were at school. She heard the children
sing "Stella Maris," she watched a procession
about the grounds, little girls making
a "Novena," and she had a glass of milk and
some cake. Best of all, one of the nuns gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her a lovely little silk banner with the figure
of Joan of Arc woven on it. This she took
home and hung on her bedroom wall. It became
one of her very dearest possessions.</p>

<p>The midnight mass as celebrated at the
Notre Dame Cathedral in Montreal is a sight
no one can forget. About eleven <small>P. M.</small> on the
night before Christmas, the wonderful chime
of bells sends out its clamor on the frosty air.
"Chim-Chime, Chim-Chime"&mdash;they sound
from out the high twin towers, and when the
Great Bourdon sounds the note in its deep
throat the notes carry many miles. It is not
sounded every day, but for weddings, funerals
and on great church festivals, and its tones are
heard above the noise of trolley cars, sleigh
bells and other street traffic. On Christmas
Eve these chimes are heard by the tired Christmas
shoppers, and the still more weary shop
girls, and the streams of people on their way
home from the theaters. Little Oisette, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
warm velvet coat, a red toque on her head and
a red knitted scarf wound around her waist,
long red stockings pulled on over her boots, and
rubbers put over these stockings, was lifted into
the family sleigh and tucked well under the
buffalo robes&mdash;she could still see the sky, full
of wonderful stars, and she could hear, even
through her toque, which was well over her
ears, the booming of the Great Bourdon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="354" height="500" alt="sleigh in city" />
<div class="caption">"THEY DROVE INTO THE CITY"</div>
</div>

<p>She liked the way the snow squeaked under
the runners of the sleigh, she liked the way the
big farm horses kicked the snow, she liked the
way the evergreen boughs, loaded with snow,
held out their branches toward her.</p>

<p>There is nothing more comfortable than one
of these Canadian sleighs full of robes; they
are built low on runners close to the ground,
and they have a high back which keeps off the
wind. The whole effect is somewhat like a
wooden bathtub on runners; the seats are wide
enough to hold a whole family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>How proud our little Quebec cousin felt to
be riding with her father, her mother, her two
sisters and two brothers! Her cheeks grew
red and redder with the thrill of it. There
were hot bricks in the bottom of the sleigh to
keep her mother's feet warm, her two sisters
held hot potatoes in their muffs. The French
Canadian knows how to conserve heat. Long
before the day of Thermos bottles and fireless
cookers he heated bricks and stones, and sealed
up the windows of his home against all wintry
blasts. It is a very stuffy atmosphere they
breathe, but there is so much latent heat stored
in their bodies that they can take a long drive,
if well muffled, without the chill of the weather
penetrating their bones.</p>

<p>Oisette Mary's eyes grew round and rounder
with surprise as they drove into the city and
she saw the blaze of electric signs for the first
time. The portals of the great church looked
very gloomy in comparison until they entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the church, and then she saw for the first time
the high altar, with its splendor of colored
lights. It is a sight to take the breath away.
Tall candles, short candles, clusters of red,
green, blue, yellow lights all twinkling like stars;
and the organ playing delightful music.</p>

<p>Her father picked Oisette up in his arms,
and they went down a long side aisle to visit
the manger of the Infant Christ. There it was,
very lifelike indeed; piles of straw, heads of
cattle, the Infant Christ in wax was lying in
some straw, and there were kneeling figures of
Joseph and Mary by its side.</p>

<p>After a while Oisette and her father were
seated in a pew very close to the chancel and
she could see the priests, nineteen in all, who
waited on the archbishop; then the little acolytes,
six in number, who waited on the priests,
were a pretty sight. The organ played
"Adeste Fidelis." Then the mass began. The
incense poured up in volumes toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
groined roof. At last Oisette fell asleep on
"bote of de eye," as the French Canadian
would express it, and she never awakened until
they were traveling homeward again.</p>



<p>"Do you know where you are, little one?"
asked the father, as he cracked his whip. "I
am on the front seat with mon père," she replied
with a sleepy smile, and curled up again
like a little dormouse.</p>

<p>Now one would imagine that when her home
was reached, Oisette Mary would, before going
to bed, hang up her stocking and prepare for
a visit from Santa Claus; or even&mdash;it being
about two o'clock in the morning&mdash;that she
might find he had already filled her stocking
or decked a Christmas tree for her delight.</p>

<p>Not a bit of it! The French Canadian child
does not give nor does she receive gifts on
Christmas Day. For these people the day is
simply a religious festival; a holy day rather
than a holiday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>So Oisette Mary, at two o'clock in the morning
of Christmas Day, was given a bowl of hot
pea soup, with plenty of onion in it&mdash;and put
to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>NEW YEAR'S DAY</small></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="girl and worman outside house watching snowshoers" />
<div class="caption">"SOME OF THE BOYS ARRIVING ON SNOWSHOES BROUGHT FRIENDS WITH THEM"</div>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">New</span> Year's Eve in the Province of Quebec
is quite another story; when that time arrived
Oisette Mary was allowed to keep very late
hours. Her brothers and sisters were all at
home; some of the boys arriving on snowshoes
brought friends with them.</p>

<p>A fiddler came (one could hardly call him a
violinist). He sat on a chair which had been
placed on a table; from this platform he called
the dances and played his fiddle and beat time
with his foot and sometimes, too, he sang to the
music, and so did all the company. It was an
orgy of sound.</p>

<p>Oisette kept awake until after supper; she
was allowed a generous slice of an especially
prepared cake known as "gillete du beurre"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which the well-to-do <i>Habitant</i> serves to his
guests at this season. Her pockets were full
of nuts and raisins, and she was holding a new
doll in her arms. As they arrived, every one
kissed her on both cheeks, as is the French
custom, and every one called out "Heureux
Année" to her; which is their way of saying
"Happy New Year."</p>

<p>During the festivities, the village Curé came
in to call. He stood and watched the dancing
and applauded the musician. He also shook
hands with each member of the family and
their guests. He sang with them, feasted with
them, and smoked with the men. He was a
very lovable character and had a wonderful
power for good among his people. He
brought Oisette a box of figs as a New Year's
offering, and he patted her on the head when
at last she went away to bed. The Curé went
home at midnight, but the party went on until
dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning, when Oisette awoke
from her slumbers, she saw on the windowsill
a little sparrow hopping about on the snowy
ledge, so she tossed back the quilts, and ran
down to her mother to beg for some crumbs.</p>

<p>To her surprise all her family objected, until
it was explained to her by her father, that,
according to a superstition that the French
Canadian holds, no person should be allowed
to carry anything out of a house on New Year's
Day until something fresh has been brought
in.</p>

<p>So she stood, with a tin biscuit box in her
hand, in which were a lot of crumbs, waiting
until some one should enter the outside door.
It was very hard work for her to wait, and
the bird seemed very impatient, but the family
had said no, and when those who are older
say no, it does not do to disobey. The French
Canadian child is naturally obedient.</p>

<p>Presently she was rewarded and her tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
turned to smiles, for with much scraping and
pounding the outer door opened and in came
her Uncle Napoleon, his arms filled with an
assortment of packages.</p>

<p>Now, Napoleon was a guest of honor, for he
was a young priest, and had but recently returned
from the city of Baltimore, in the United
States, where he had been in retreat. He, too,
kissed all his relatives on both cheeks, as he
distributed his gifts. When he came to little
Oisette he put in her hand a small box, the
top of which was full of small holes. "Have
a care, little one," he said, "for your gift is
alive."</p>

<p>Oisette was so thrilled that she let her tin
box drop with a bang, crumbs and all. "Is
it a mouse?" she ventured, "or a bird, mon
oncle?"</p>

<p>Napoleon laughed and shook his head.
"This box will make a good home for it," he
said. "If we find some sand, some stones and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
some water." "It is a fish then!" declared
her father, only he called it "un poisson."</p>

<p>In the meantime the little girl placed the
package on the table and opened it carefully.
"Oh&mdash;oo! la-la," she said, as out walked,
very, very slowly, a baby turtle&mdash;just two
inches long from tip to tip.</p>

<p>There were directions with it, from the vicar
at St. Remo, explaining that it was full size and
would need a little water to live in, a few
crumbs and flies to live on.</p>

<p>So with stones taken from a flower pot, and
sand from a celery box, a nice home was made
inside the tin biscuit box.</p>

<p>On an island or dock formed by the stones
and a bit of wood, the little turtle came out to
sun himself when tired of the water. It was
amusing, indeed, to watch him study his own
image which was reflected in the side of the tin
box. This tin, you see, was as clear and bright
as a mirror, and to watch him bob his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
about as he stopped to reflect on his new estate
made the whole family laugh like children.</p>

<p>His little mistress wanted to call him "Vanity,"
but her Uncle Napoleon told her that
the good vicar of St. Remo had named him
"Jean Batiste," which is the French for John
the Baptist!</p>

<p>Oisette was a tender-hearted little girl and
she did not long forget that there were some
little birds out in the cold dooryard, waiting for
her to feed them. "Now, you see," she explained
to her uncle, "since you have entered
our house and brought in a turtle, I can carry
out some crumbs to the poor oiseaux,&mdash;and, I
suppose," she mused, "it means that we shall
have turtles coming in all the year since a turtle
was the first thing brought in on the glad New
Year's Day."</p>

<p>Her Uncle Napoleon laughed very hard at
this philosophy, and said: "But I should think
the milk was brought in the first thing very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
early this morning, was it not, little one? Certainly
you will have milk all the year, will you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in her father. "We must
thank the Bon Dieu that we shall have milk
all the year."</p>

<p>Why had they not thought of that sooner,
Oisette wondered, and not kept the birds waiting
all this time! She could hear them now,
chirp, chirp, chirp as though to hurry her.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Jean Batiste put his
head out and winked solemnly and Oisette Mary
opened the outer door and threw out plenty
of crumbs; so it would seem that everybody
and everything about the Tremblent farm had
a Happy New Year.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>NEW NEIGHBORS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> January an English-speaking family
rented a house right next to the Tremblent
home. Oisette watched them as they moved
in, with the greatest interest; she soon discovered
that there were two girls and a smaller
boy. The boy seemed to be about her own age.</p>

<p>As soon as they were settled, their governess
came out from the city of Montreal, on a tram
car, to teach them each morning. Oisette
learned also to watch for her appearance.</p>

<p>Then, when the mysterious lessons were over,
the pupils, well bundled in very warm clothing,
would escort their governess to the trolley station;
after that they were free to play out in
the beautiful snow all the day long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>They built a huge snow fort to keep out the
Indians, which the boy insisted still lurked in
the woods back of Mount Royal. They built
a snow house to live in, a room for each one
of them, and an extra room for guests, since
there was plenty of snow; and, last of all, they
started a wonderful snow man, which was to
stand on guard at the house door.</p>

<p>At first Oisette was terribly shy about playing
with them, but they were inclined to be
friendly with her and even tried to talk in the
French tongue with her, for their governess had
told them to do so. When finally they saved
a bone every day for Carleau, so that he spent
most of his daylight hours in holding the fort
for them, and when they begged Oisette to
show them her turtle, she was won over.</p>

<p>And after a week or so she boldly showed
them how to improve their snow man by marking
his face with lumps of charcoal for eyes,
red flannel for lips, an old pipe stuck in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mouth, and a very battered old hat of her
father's on his head, she became their strongest
ally. In fact she received so much praise from
the Dudley family that she became quite embarrassed.
However, she learned to call them
all by their baptismal names. Such good sturdy
English names they were. The boy was George
Howard Dudley, he being named for King
George of England of course, and the elder
girl was Alexandra May after the Dowager
Queen and present queen of England, and the
younger was called Victoria after her own
grandmother, who, in her time, had been named
after Queen Victoria, who reigned over the
British Empire so many, many years. This
younger little Dudley girl was always called
"Queenie," which name Oisette thought was
very beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>One day they were all out toboganning together
on the hillside when a funeral procession
passed along the road below. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hearse appeared in sight little Oisette stopped
in her play and crossed herself; the others,
after a moment, stopped their shrill screaming
too, and waited respectfully.</p>

<p>One of the children who was sliding on the
hillside that morning was a little American
cousin from Plattsburgh, New York; being a
newcomer, she had never before seen a hearse
just like this one.</p>

<p>It was white all over, runners and body and
harness, and on the four corners of this hearse
were figures made in white plaster; these figures
represented kneeling angels, and they had gold
tipped wings and were holding long gold
trumpets to their lips. In the center of the top
of this vehicle was an upright gilt cross and
from it floated long streamers of white, these
flapped in the chill wind.</p>

<p>Three sleigh loads of mourners followed,
and though they had black crepe streamers tied
to their fur caps, they did not appear mournful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at all, for the men were smoking pipes and
chatting together, and they all leaned out to
look at the snow man which the children had
constructed.</p>

<p>Among the well-to-do French Canadian families
in the Province of Quebec, a white hearse
and a white casket is always used for the burial
of a child. If they cannot afford this, they
simply hire "a rig" as they call it; and put
as many of the family on the rear seat as the
space will allow, and on the front seat sits the
father and drives the horse, while in his lap
he holds the tiny white coffin, and in it is the
body of the little dead child. Many, many
of these primitive funeral processions pass
along the Cote-des-Neiges Road to the Roman
Catholic Cemetery which lies behind the mountain&mdash;for
the infant mortality in this particular
province is very, very heavy.</p>

<p>On Saturdays, and on Sunday afternoons,
too, this road takes a more cheerful aspect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
when hundreds of boys and girls arrive on snow
shoes, or come in long sleighs, dragging toboggans
behind them, for these hills back of Mount
Royal are a splendid winter playground. Almost
every winter there is a ski-jumping contest,
when some wonderful athletes come from
Norway and other Northern countries to compete
with these young Canadian athletes.</p>

<p>Then, too, there are young Frenchmen who
love to race their horses, sometimes they practice
the speed of a mare along these roads,
and then some beautiful Sunday afternoon they
take part in horse races along the river road.</p>

<p>In wintertime it is so very cold that the great
St. Lawrence river is frozen solid, and all day
long traffic is driven over this ice from shore
to shore. From the top of Mount Royal one
can distinctly see the road which leads from
the city of Montreal to a good-sized town on
the south shore known as Longueil. This road
is marked by little evergreen trees which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
been cut from the forest and placed along either
side of the roadway, to mark the path when
dusk draws on. It is a very picturesque sight
to watch this river road on a busy morning,
when one can see a procession of red or blue
box sleighs, each one being driven by a <i>Habitant</i>
farmer, who sits on his bags of potatoes and
onions and pork, and jogs along very comfortably
toward the great city.</p>

<p>Once every winter Monsieur Tremblent
would drive his fine team of horses over from
Montreal to Longueil by the river road to call
on some of his political friends and that year
he allowed little Oisette to go with him, and
she begged to take the little Dudley girls with
her, so they were all wrapped up with extra
care and cuddled down among the robes on
the rear seat, and when it was too late to send
him back, it was discovered that Carleau had
followed them when they left the island of
Montreal and started out on the wide river's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
frozen surface. The little Dudleys were just
a little nervous at first, but they saw so many
teams in front of them going toward the opposite
shore that at last they forgot about the
great river which lay under the frozen road.</p>

<p>This shore at first looked like a thin blue line;
by and by it began to look like a wall, and at
last the children could see roads and houses
and churches, and when they looked back there
was the great city of Montreal, which they had
left; now it looked like a thin blue line.</p>

<p>Carleau caused some excitement by chasing
off after another dog, and leaving the prescribed
route. They had to stop the horses
and call "Carleau, Carleau, mauvais chien,"
to coax him back again. When he did return,
he was told to jump into the sleigh and lie
down under the robes, at the children's feet.
Once in a while, if the sleigh gave an extra
bump, he would give a short bark, but it was
hardly noticed at all above the jingle of sleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bells, the laughter of the children and the squeak
of the runners over the ice.</p>

<p>On each side of this road enterprising business
men have placed advertisements, printed
both in English and in French. The Dudley
children found great delight in reading these
aloud; for already their governess had taught
them to read and to spell very well indeed.</p>

<p>Our little Quebec cousin had to maintain a
discreet silence, for she had never been to school
and could not yet read either French or English.
On Sundays she recited her catechism
to the Curé, and in another year's time she
would go to a convent, to be educated by the
nuns, as her older sisters were now being
taught.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Monsieur Tremblent could well
afford to educate his children, but there are
many French Canadians who never learn to
read nor write, because education is not free
in this province and is not compulsory. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
this not a very sad condition of things to exist
in a Christian country in the twentieth century!
But we must not blame these people individually.
Remember, it is the government which
controls such matters. Oisette had a quick
mind and sharp eyes and by listening to the
chatter of these English tongues she picked up
a great deal of information.</p>

<p>Each morning, all that winter, our little Quebec
cousin waited patiently for her playmates
to finish their lessons, and be ready to come out
and play with her. She had been told that
she must wait and not disturb them, so she
sat all hooded and cloaked by her cottage window
until she heard their voices. The French
Canadian child certainly has two good traits,
Obedience and Patience.</p>

<p>When her neighbors finally came trooping
out, she would open her own door with one of
her slow smiles and call out "Bon Jour, mes
amis," and then Carleau, who had waited just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as patiently as his little mistress, would rend
the air with barks and yelps of joy, and the
wonderful playtime would commence.</p>

<p>While the snow still lies deep in the woods,
but the March winds and sunshine are causing
the sap to rise in the trees, comes the magical
time in the Province of Quebec, known as
"Maple Sugar Time." In early days the
Indians, who then inhabited this land, tapped
his trees aslant with a tomahawk and inserted
above this opening a strip of wood or pipe from
which the sap fell drop by drop into a birch
bark receptacle. This sap was boiled in earthenware
vessels. In this way they obtained a
quantity of thick black syrup, the only sugar
used by the Indians. As the sap was always
boiled in the open, bits of bark fell into it and
it had a smoky taste. But about fifty years ago,
this maple sugar industry was more carefully
looked after, and nowadays the well-to-do
farmer has a sugar house, and a fine grove of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
maple trees, and glittering tin sap buckets hang
on all the trees; and instead of a large iron
kettle for boiling the sap, evaporators have
been installed, where the sap runs in thin and
clear and comes out a beautiful light brown
sirup.</p>

<p>Imagine the joy of little Oisette when she was
allowed to go to a sugaring off with her little
English neighbors. They drove off from the
main highroad into a path in the woods where
the runners of the sleigh sunk in deep slush
and snow, and finally came to this tiny house
in the heart of the wood. There was a fine
wood fire under the evaporator, and from it
steam was rising. The contents gave out a
most delicious aroma.</p>

<p>Each child was given a spoon and a saucer,
and in the saucer was poured about a cupful
of boiling hot sirup; this fluid had to be stirred
around and around fast and faster, until it
thickened. When it was about the consistency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of butter it was spread on slices of bread and
eaten while it was still hot. Each child tried
to see who could be ready first. The Dudley
children were expert at it, and sang "Waltz
me around again, Willie, around, around,
around," as they stirred. Oisette felt shy with
so many English children and would only say
"Voilà" when her sugar was ready to be consumed.</p>

<p>Some of the older members of the party
tried another method. They packed a pan full
of clean white snow, gathered in the woods,
and pounded it down very smooth and hard;
on this was poured the very hot sirup, which
formed at once into a sort of toffee, thin but
clear and delicious to taste, but very chewey,
somebody called it "The dentist's friend," because
eating it is apt to loosen fillings in one's
teeth.</p>

<p>Carleau, Monsieur Tremblent's dog, had
arrived at the sugar house with the sleigh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
some one was unkind enough to give him a bit
of this maple toffee. Poor Carleau, it glued
his teeth tight together so that he could not
bark, nor could he chew. The only thing he
could do was to shake his head sadly from side
to side and whine and whine and whine. This
act made the whole party laugh in chorus, and
dogs are very sensitive creatures, so when he
discovered that this derision was directed
toward him, he forsook the party altogether
and trotted off home alone.</p>

<p>Later on in the afternoon, there came a time
when the merrymakers themselves began to
feel a little ill at ease, and longed to be off
home and get a good drink of water. Then
some one produced a big bottle of pickles and
passed those about. Pickles never tasted so
good before to any one as they did to that
sugaring off party in the Canadian woods.</p>

<p>When the little girls were again in the big
sleigh, ready to go home, each one was presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with a nice little cake of sugar, with
escalloped edges. Oisette put hers carefully
away in her treasure box. It was quite a long
time before she cared to eat it: and as for
Carleau, when he smelled sirup boiling in his
master's kitchen, he fled out of doors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is marvelous to watch such a winter break
up. The snow, which has planted its four
feet deep in the city streets, is, of course, carted
away on the main thoroughfares, so that the
cars can be operated with the aid of sweepers
and shovelers; but on the side streets when
after a big storm the snow is piled in banks
each side of the pavement, it is very like walking
through a beautiful white tunnel, of course
the tunnel has no top, and one is able to see
the beautiful blue sky overhead, and to hear
the jingle of many sleighbells, as no vehicle
on runners is allowed to proceed without these
bells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The ice in the river, early in April, begins
to crack and groan until suddenly on some
sunny day, with a roar of sound, it piles itself
high upon the banks. The melting snow on
the hillsides runs down to meet it; the icicles,
which have hung like white fringe everywhere,
drop, drop, drop&mdash;like ripe fruit. Presently
the double windows and storm doors are taken
from off the buildings. The foliage on Mount
Royal comes out a lovely green, the wooded
hills are full of violets and trilliums, the latter
is a three-leaved white lily, white and graceful,
and when brought into captivity will thrive for
a week if it has plenty of water. Summer
comes on with a rush, and up the side of Mount
Royal the elevator starts running for the season.
Do you see the only springtime is when
winter may be said to leap into summer!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A SIGHT-SEEING TOUR</small></h2>


<p>One beautiful June morning, Miss Anstruther,
the governess for the Dudley children,
decided that she would like to take her pupils
on a sight-seeing tour about the city of Montreal,
so that their study of local history might
become something more than dry facts and
dates to be memorized.</p>

<p>When they boarded the "around the mountain"
car, they were delighted to find Oisette
Mary sitting beside her mother in one of the
front seats. Her hair was braided extra tight
and her cheeks shone with soap; otherwise
she was her placid little self.</p>

<p>The Dudley children were in high spirits
and they raced through the car to get seats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
near their chum. "We are to study with our
eyes and ears to-day and not from books.
Can't you come along with us?"</p>

<p>Finally Madame Tremblent was appealed to.
She was on her way for a morning's shopping
and she always went to The Bon Marche, kept
by The Dupuis Freres, where all the clerks
were French, and all the signs read in that
language; she was armed with a long list of
necessities for her growing family, and as
Oisette was sadly in need of a hat she had been
commanded to escort her parent thither.</p>

<p>When they reached the Mount Royal station,
where every one must transfer east or west,
Miss Anstruther, gathering from the look of
appeal in the little French girl's eyes that she
really would like to join the sight-seers, said
to the mother, in her soft French accent, "If
Madame would trust her little girl to me, I
would select the hat at Goodwears Departmental,
as we have a message there to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
some boots for George; and I recently purchased
these sailor hats the children are now
wearing in their millinery department. She
could wear the new hat home and I would have
the heavy one sent out on the noon delivery."
Oisette was wearing a purple felt hat adorned
with a green bow and the day was warm.</p>

<p>Now, Madame Tremblent had herself longed
to shop just once in the English part of the
city, but the thought of going alone, lest she
should not find persons who talked French, had
prevented her from doing so. It came to her
that if she let Oisette go just once in such good
company, why, in a week or so the child could
be her mother's guide and she would see for
herself all the wonderful things she had heard
her neighbors discuss as they walked home from
mass each Sunday. So she drew from her
petticoat pocket a huge wallet and thrusting a
bill in Miss Anstruther's hand burst into a
volley of French directed to her offspring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
be attentive, to take care and not to be too
late in returning home. Just then the tram
for the east end appeared around the curve,
and Madame was gone before the surprised
governess could make any reply. The children
tried to say it all over again&mdash;"Soyez exact
chez moi," "Prenez garde and bon jour."</p>

<p>"Prenez garde means safety first," explained
Miss Anstruther, "so I beg you all to keep with
me, for Madame's advice was good, and here
comes our car for the west end."</p>

<p>Even the milliner took an interest in little
Oisette. "It is so unusual to see the two nationalities
shopping together," she said. It did
not take long to find a white sailor hat with a
gold and white ribbon around the crown, a facsimile
of the one Queenie was wearing; and
the other errands being done, they set out for
the Château de Ramezay in a cab. Their way
lead down a steep hill, past The Windsor Hotel
and Dominion Square. In this square Oisette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
found another statue to admire. This one was
the bronze figure of a horse rampant and a
figure of a Canadian soldier was holding the
animal by its bridle. This statue is known as
The Strathcona Horse and was erected in memory
of the brave Canadian boys who fell in the
South African war. The regiment was called
The Strathcona Horse after Lord Strathcona,
a very wealthy Scotch Canadian who financed
it in 1898.</p>

<p>"Did he race his horses?" asked the little
French girl, for horse racing was something
she understood. This question made every one
in the car laugh, and Oisette was glad when
the car turned into "Rue Notre Dame" for
here she was more at home and able to tell her
little friends more about the narrow streets
that lead down to the river; how it was possible
in olden days to barricade each end of a narrow
thoroughfare from the Indians; finally they
passed her beloved Notre Dame church, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
about a half mile further on they came to the
Château de Ramezay.</p>

<p>Here they alighted and entered a quaint old
gateway, flanked on each side by pyramids of
ancient cannon and cannon balls. The door,
with its curious knocker, stood open, and, entering,
they found themselves in a low ceiled
hall.</p>

<p>The history of this building is contemporary
with that of the city for the last two centuries
and so identified with past historical events that
it has been preserved from vandalism of modern
improvement and is a genuine relic of the
old Régime in New France. Though only a
story and a half high, the Norman turrets on
either corner of the building add to its dignity,
and the plaster walls (plastered over thick
stone walls) have a rich yellow color, reminding
one of an ancient vellum missal mellowed
for centuries in a monkish cell.</p>

<p>In an old document still to be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
archives of the St. Sulpician Order, it is recorded
that the land on which this château stands was
ceded to the Governor of Montreal in the year
1660, about eighteen years after Maisonneuve
planted the silken Fleur-de-Lys of France on
these shores. Somewhere about 1700 a part
of this land was acquired by Claude de Ramezay,
when he came from France as a captain
in the army with the Viceroy de Tracy, and was
for many years Governor of Montreal and held
official court in the Council Chamber to the
right of the entrance hall.</p>

<p>It was into this room that Miss Anstruther
first ushered her party, another long low room
now used as a museum of rare and very valuable
relics of Canada's past. Everything is labeled
by the Antiquarian Society which has this building
in its keeping. There were buckles once
the property of some gay French chevalier&mdash;there
were bones of a young Indian maiden
discovered when builders on the mountainside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
were excavating for a modern dwelling early
in this century, even her wampum belt was
there, and from it those versed in Indian
lore were able to tell her age, her tribe
and the fact that she had become Christianized.</p>

<p>Miss Anstruther instructed Queenie to read
in French all the labels aloud and let Oisette
translate for them; in this way they got on
famously. On the left of the entrance is a
salon where there is an old harpsichord, some
very interesting old oil portraits of early
French governors, and some curious candelabras
and other furnishings of an early period. This
salon was where Madame de Ramezay entertained
her friends from France. How strange
must these gayeties have seemed to the dweller
of the wigwam as the lights from the château
shone out into the night! Once, long, long
ago, there was a garden in the rear of the
château which reached to the very water's edge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
so the sound of the dancing and the laughter
must have carried out on the stream. Nowadays
this land behind the château is filled with
warehouses, and the view of the river gone for
all time.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the burden-bearing squaws
must have been the gay French women in their
powder and patches and hair dressed a la
Pompadour as they danced a minuet in their
stiff brocades and sparkling jewels, to the sound
of a harpsichord.</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Oh, fair young land of La Nouvelle France,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With the halo of olden time romance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Back like a half forgotten dream</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Comes the bygone days of the Old Régime."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Some visitor wrote those words in the visitors'
book where every one is asked to inscribe
his name.</p>

<p>After the children had absorbed the most important
contents of these two rooms they were
ushered down a long flight of stairs, ladder-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in their steepness, into the vaults of the
château.</p>

<p>These vaults were once the kitchens and
laundry of the great château, the fireplaces were
so huge the children walked right into them.</p>

<p>They were shown old spinning wheels, old
churns, a curious wooden bread-making machine
and a mammoth brick oven, where twenty loaves
of bread could be baked with one firing. So
one gathers that not all who lived in this château
were gay idlers after all.</p>

<p>The most interesting vault was one leading
out of these kitchens, as it was inky black owing
to its having iron shutters, closed over closely
barred windows. This, it is said, was where
the family, the guests and all the servants had
sometimes to hide from the Indians. When
news came that some hostile tribe was entering
the city all the women and children would be
sent "en bas" (below).</p>

<p>After the English had taken Canada from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
French, this same château was occupied by
Sir Jeffry Amherst in his British uniform, and
it is possible that from his garden he looked
out over the river toward St. Helen's Island
and watched the smoke and flame arise from the
fire when General de Levis burned his colors
rather than let them fall into English hands.</p>

<p>Then again, in 1775, the Chateau de
Ramezay was the headquarters of the Continental
army of America, and Commissioners
met in the council chamber to try and untangle
affairs after Montgomery's siege of Quebec had
failed.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was one of this commission,
and down in the old vaults he set up the
first printing-press that Canada ever had, and
he issued manifestoes to the people.</p>

<p>"So, you see," said Miss Anstruther, as they
finally left this famous spot, "that one building
has housed first the French, then the English,
and for a time some famous Americans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
nowadays tourists from all nations come to see
its contents. It is the grandest relic of an
illustrious past, and now, when you take up your
history books and find the names of some of
these men and women, they will seem more like
people to you."</p>

<p>They had a long trolley ride into the west
end of the city again, for they wished to reach
the Grey Nunnery on the stroke of twelve,
noon, for at this hour visitors are admitted to
the Chapel.</p>

<p>At last the conductor rang his bell, stopped
the car and called out&mdash;"Guy&mdash;Gee&mdash;Guy"&mdash;you
see, "Guy" is the name of the
street on which this convent has a visitors' entrance.
The French pronunciation sounds like
"Gee," and as the conductor gives both French
and English names when he calls the streets it
made the children all laugh to hear "Guy&mdash;Gee&mdash;Guy&mdash;Grey
Nunnery for you, Madame."
This convent, so called from the dress of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
community, was founded in 1692, when Louis
Fourteenth granted power to establish general
hospitals and other institutions for the relief of
the sick and aged poor in different parts of the
country. In a cemetery under the chapel lie
buried the bones of some of the sisters who long
ago came from France to found this order in a
barren land&mdash;they have the heart of the first
Mother Superior preserved in alcohol, but this
is shown only to a devout few.</p>

<p>A fire destroyed their first building, but the
present convent has stood as it is about seventy
years and over the main entrance is the inscription&mdash;"Mon
père et ma mère m'ont abandonne,
mais le seigneur m'a recivelli." The
governess read this aloud to her charges and
then translated it into "My father and my
mother may forsake me but the Saviour will
receive me."</p>

<p>This building of massive gray limestone
occupies a whole block and houses one thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
souls. There are tiny babes whose parents
have deserted them, there are older boys and
girls, orphans, there are sick and aged old men
and women, there are one hundred nuns and
ninety novices to do all the work. All these
lives are regulated by the sound of a convent
bell.</p>

<p>Exactly on the stroke of twelve noon, the
chapel doors open and visitors are admitted.
As soon as they are seated the nuns file in two
by two, and recite the stations of the Cross
in a low monotone. Often some nun with a
very beautiful voice sings an anthem. When
the service is over a diminutive sister remains
behind as a guide to take visitors over the
building; one who speaks French or English
equally well.</p>

<p>It is all very clean, from the great kitchens
with vats of pea soup boiling and the laundries
filled with steam in the basement, to the very
top of the building where there are play rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for the tiny tots. Here some of the older
children line up and sing for the visitors and
are quite ready to receive coins or candies.
There is one room where blind people are
taught to read and to do bead work, it is interesting
to watch them select the right shade of
bead by simply feeling the end of the box which
holds them.</p>

<p>In another room there are nimble fingers
making wax flowers, weaving lace and doing
embroidery.</p>

<p>The drug store was redolent with drugs and
a young nun was busy filling prescriptions; she
laughed very hard when Queenie exclaimed:
"Why, I smell Gregory's mixture!" In a
tiny room there was a dental chair, in which
was seated a young orphan, and a nun was
busy filling this child's teeth. Nobody was
idle, even the very old men and women helped
with the scrubbing of the floors and woodwork.</p>

<p>It was just one o'clock when they came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
again at the Guy Street entrance, and Miss
Anstruther said it was high time they had
luncheon. So they went to La Corona Café
on that same street, and there, in a delightful
out of door garden, they sat at a small table
with the lovely blue sky above them and flowers
all about them, and a very attentive waiter.
It is quite like a Parisian café. During their
meal they chatted together about what they
had seen, and asked eagerly about what was to
follow.</p>

<p>"It is a puzzle to decide," said Miss Anstruther,
"whether we had best go up on Mount
Royal where from that elevation I could point
out to you many historic spots of interest, including
St. Helen's Island named after Champlain's
wife, who was a French Helen somebody&mdash;and
Victoria Bridge built when the
late King Edward was a boy of eighteen and
he came out here on a tour, and stopped to
drive the last rivet in this bridge, and the location<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Dollard's Lane, named from a brave
young Frenchman who fought the Iroquois&mdash;or
shall we go out to Lachine by trolley in
time to take the boat over the rapids, that
will bring us into the docks by supper time and
out home a half hour later.</p>

<p>"I vote for whichever will have the most
about Indians," said George, "we can see the
Victoria Bridge when we travel any day." At
this moment a party of French politicians entered
the enclosure and Oisette's eyes dilated
with amazement, "Mon père!" she exclaimed.
Sure enough, it was Monsieur Tremblent, and
he, too, was amazed to behold his little girl
in a new white sailor hat. Miss Anstruther explained
how Oisette happened to be with them,
so he took a great interest in their plans, and
after consulting with his party found he could
put a motor car at Miss Anstruther's disposal;
in this they could cover more ground in the
city and be taken out to Lachine, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
party could see the rapids and the car could
be brought back to its owner at five o'clock,
when he would be returning from the political
meeting.</p>

<p>Their plans were soon made, and their first
stop was to be on Sherbrooke Street just west
of Guy Street, where behind huge gray stone
walls, is situated the grand seminary of the
Sulpician Order. Entering these grounds, they
could see the huge building which houses four
hundred or more students, all preparing for
the priesthood, but one reason of their visit
was to see the two stone towers in the grounds
which were built in very early times and remain
standing in an excellent state of preservation.
One of these old towers was used as a chapel
for the Indian mission and the other as a
school. A tablet on the chapel tower bears
the inscription "Here rest the mortal remains
of a Huron Indian baptized by the Reverend
Père de Brebeuf. He was, by his piety and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by his probity, the example of the Christians,
and the admiration of the unbelievers; he died
aged one hundred years the 21st of April,
1690."</p>

<p>Miss Anstruther reminded George that he
had but recently read in Parkman's history
about this same Rev. Père de Brebeuf, who
was tortured to death by the Iroquois with
every cruelty devisable.</p>

<p>The school held in the other tower had, at
one time, a famous native teacher; she was
called "the school mistress of the mountains,"
and died in 1695, when but twenty-eight years
old. Above the door of the western wing of
the great seminary is the legend in Latin "Hie
evangel; bantur Indi," "Here the Indians were
evangelized."</p>

<p>Next they rode along Sherbrooke Street, past
a beautiful art gallery and some fine residences
to the McGill University grounds, which lie at
the foot of the mountain slope. This college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was founded in 1821 and named from its
founder the Honorable James McGill. Then,
just a little further on, is the Royal Victoria
college for women, donated by Lord Strathcone,
and a beautiful statue of Queen Victoria
ornaments the entrance steps&mdash;this statue was
designed by the Princess Louise, one of Queen
Victoria's own children. Miss Anstruther said
she hoped some day her little students would
become McGill graduates.</p>

<p>As motors are not allowed on Mount Royal,
it was decided that they would go out to Lachine
by the lower road, in this way they passed very
many interesting places. Near the <i>Place
d'Armes</i> stood the house of Sieur du Luth,
from whom the city of Duluth was named, and
west of St. Lambert hill was a tiny house once
the home of Cadillac, who left the then little
French village to proceed westward and found
the now beautiful city of Detroit.</p>

<p>In the years which came after, such men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Washington Irving, General Montgomery, Benjamin
Franklin, Benedict Arnold, John Jacob
Astor all lived for some time in Montreal, and
all had something to do with the making of its
history. In many places the Antiquarian Society
has marked the various sites where these
famous men made their homes.</p>

<p>On this lower road to Lachine, and within
hearing of the sound of the rapids, stands a
very old windmill, said to have been built in
1666 when La Salle came to Montreal,&mdash;there
are also crumbling remains of a fortified château
nearby and there is a well-founded legend that
the old chimney attached thereto was built
by Samuel de Champlain himself in his trading
post of logs. The snowflakes of three
hundred winters have fallen into that great fireplace
since those stones and mortar were laid.</p>

<p>The Lachine Rapids were first run by a
steamer in the summer of 1840 by the side-wheeler
<i>Ontario</i>&mdash;afterward this boat's name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was changed to <i>The Lord Sydenham</i>&mdash;and for
very many years an Indian pilot took the wheel
and steered the course over treacherous rock
and reef. From very early times these rapids
had been navigated by Indians in their frail
canoes, and they knew where the water was
deep enough for a large boat to go.</p>

<p>George Dudley was keen to see the village
of Lachine itself and seemed quite worried
because everybody was alive and well, as he had
but recently read in his history of the Massacre
of Lachine, but he had forgotten that it happened
in 1689. It was in the summer of that
year that the Iroquois descended upon this
little hamlet on a very dark night and surrounded
every house at midnight, and then with
terrible yells and war-whoops destroyed every
house and killed every living being.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock when the little
party left their borrowed automobile and
boarded the steamer to shoot the rapids&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
got right in the bow of the boat and Oisette
stood on a chair where she could see the flying
spray.</p>

<p>Altogether, it had been a wonderful event
in her life, for French Canadian children, as
a rule, do not have a whole day's outing, and
when at last she was home again and tried to
tell her mother about it, the good woman
crossed herself to think of the dangers her little
girl had come through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>A LITTLE TRAVELER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Industry</span> is another trait which our little
Quebec cousin has to her credit.</p>

<p>The interior of Oisette's home was filled with
objects which go to prove this. For instance,
all the bed clothes, with the exception of the
sheets, consist of gay patchwork quilts.
French Canadian children learn to sew patchwork
when they are very young indeed. Oisette
learned to put together red and blue and yellow
and white cotton cubes, which were made
into wonderful squares of patchwork, just as
soon as she could hold a needle that some
older person threaded for her. She could
thread her own needle long before she knew
how to tell what hour it was by the clock.</p>

<p>She knew that to have a quilt one must first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
make thirty-six of these squares. In the
Tremblent household were not only quilts that
had been pieced together by a great grandmother
who had resided in Quebec City, but
bedspreads made by a grandmother who lived
across the river in a little village named Chambly,
and many made by her own mother when
she was a little girl.</p>

<p>Indeed, on Oisette's own bed was a quilt of
marvelous pattern made by an aunt for whom
Oisette was named. This aunt had since become
a cloistered nun, and was shut in from the
gay world and spent her time mostly in prayer!</p>

<p>The pattern was known as "The music of
the spheres." It consisted of circular bits of
red and yellow cotton, which looked like onions
floating in a bright blue sky. Right in the
center of the counterpane was a big purple
star, the long points of this star were tipped
with yellow cotton and reached right to the
edge of the bedspread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>This comforter was used for the first time
when little Oisette Mary was only thirty-six
hours old. She was taken by her father and
her aunt to the church to be christened; you
know a French Canadian child is always christened
within three days after birth, and when
the tiny babe was put back in its mother's bed
the wonderful quilt was spread over the foot
of the bedstead and the proud father declared
that the little one opened its eyes and noticed
the lovely colors even then.</p>

<p>A few months later, when she was old enough
to be put down on the floor, she showed a
great fancy for the rag rugs, with their gay
stripes. These rugs are called <i>Habitant</i> carpets,
and are made by the industrious method
of sewing together long strips of colored cloth,
these strips are rolled into big balls, as large
as one's head, and six of these balls, when
woven with carpet thread, make a very pretty
rug. Most of the convents have looms where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they will weave these balls for a small sum of
money per yard.</p>

<p>There is something very cheering about the
interior of a French Canadian domicile. First
of all, there is usually much clean paint, either
yellow paint like the clearest sunlight or bright
blue paint like a summer sky. Then the window
panes sparkle with cleanness, and the window-sills
are filled with flowering geraniums
and fuchsias, the latter plant being a great favorite
in the French Canadian home. These
flowers are usually growing in tin cans, but the
tin is always very bright and shining. Then
the wall papers are never dull or dark in color.
Often they are either designs of bright flowers
or gold stars. The pictures on the walls are
always of interest. First and foremost there
is always a picture of the Pope. Then a picture
of the Christ, and very often indeed
one finds a picture of Madame Albani in
all her diamonds and tiara as she appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
when she sung for Queen Victoria at Windsor
Castle.</p>

<p>Albani, indeed, was a little Quebec cousin
who became world famous. She was born at
Chambly, near Montreal, in 1852, within sound
of the roaring rapids of the River Richelieu,
and in sight of the old historical fort. She
was the oldest daughter of one Joseph Lajeunesse,
who was a musician of sorts, playing the
piano, the fiddle, the harp and the organ. Indeed,
he played the church organ at Chambly
for many years, and he taught singing in the
Sacred Heart Convent at Back River. When
little Emma Lajeunesse was twelve years of
age, the family moved to Albany, New York,
and she went to a convent school there, where
her voice was discovered when she sang in the
cathedral. It was the citizens of that city who
made up a purse and sent her over to Italy
to study music. And so out of gratitude she
called herself Madame Albani. But when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
became famous she returned to Montreal many,
many times on concert tours, and was much
loved by her own people there, who secured
her picture to ornament their homes, and always
speak of her as "The lady who sings better
than the birds."</p>

<p>Dr. Drummond, who lived in the Province
of Quebec, once wrote some delightful verses
in the broken English of the <i>Habitant</i> farmer,
which lines describe hearing Madame Albani
sing:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Dat song I will never forget me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Twas song of de leetle bird,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When he's fly from its nes' on de tree top,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Fore rest of de worl' get stirred.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Madame she was tole us about it, den start off so quiet an' low,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sing lak de bird on de morning, de poor little small oiseau."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then the last stanza goes like this&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem'>
"We're not de beeg place on our canton, mebbe cole on de winter too,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But de heart's 'Canayen' on our body an' dat's warm enough for true!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An w'en All-ba-nee was got lonesome for travel all roun' de worl'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I hope she'll come home lak de bluebird an' again be de Chambly girl!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>That, you see, is why the photograph of
Madame Albani is given a place of honor in
our little Quebec cousin's home.</p>

<p>There is one ornament also that is never missing
from the French-Canadian interior, no matter
how shabby the surroundings. There is
always a crucifix, which teaches its lesson of
sacrifice and love to all.</p>

<p>These people are a home-abiding race.
They travel but little. If they have a fiddle
and a pack of cards for amusement, they do
not feel the lure of the moving picture theaters.
Sometimes, if any of the family get ill, they
will make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St.
Anne de Beaupré. But very many of them
never leave their happy homes for even one
night.</p>

<p>Oisette was twelve years of age before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
made her first long visit away from home. To
be sure, she had been at the convent school
for three years, but that was on the Island of
Montreal, and one journeyed there by driving.
But to go by night boat to Quebec one hundred
and sixty miles away, that was traveling.</p>

<p>Just as the city clocks and church bells were
sounding their seven o'clock duet, the big night
boat for Quebec, known as the steamer <i>Richelieu</i>,
swung out into mid-stream. The current
of the river St. Lawrence is very rapid just
here, opposite the city of Montreal.</p>

<p>On the rear deck Monsieur Tremblent was
standing and his little daughter Oisette Mary
was with him. The month was June and the
weather was very beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>The little traveler gazed with rapture at the
receding shores, bathed in a lovely sunset glow.
Everything pleased her; she would like to have
opened all the stateroom doors and taken a
peep inside, but her father explained to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that this was not allowed, except stateroom
number seventeen, for that he had a large key;
and presently she could go to bed in the top
berth, and watch the panorama of moving shore
line from out the port hole. But she wanted
to sit up as long as her eyes would stay open
and watch the travelers ascend and descend the
very grand staircase. Above the mirror, which
one always finds on these river boats, just halfway
up the staircase, was a full length portrait
of Richelieu himself, in his gorgeous robes, and
holding a scroll in his hand. Oisette tried
hard to remember his name, and wondered
if he had been a Pope! She would ask the
good sisters at the convent when she had to
return to her lessons.</p>

<p>Presently she discovered in the salon, a large
glass counter, like in a shop, where all sorts
of fancy goods were displayed for sale.</p>

<p>There were Indian baskets, picture post
cards, and jewelry and candy. Her father told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
her she might buy a present to take to his mother
who lived in the city of Quebec; she became so
absorbed trying to discover what she could find
that her grandmère would like that she never
missed her father at all, she stood just where
he had left her and gazed and gazed; while
he was on the lower deck, having bought a
cigar he stopped to chat with a commercial
traveler from Ontario, who was much interested
to hear about the melon farm; and
followed Mr. Tremblent back again up the
grand staircase, when he went to find his little
girl.</p>

<p>Oisette had just decided upon an Indian basket
for her grandmother. This basket was
woven in green and pink straw and shaped
like a melon. "It will hold her knitting," she
explained. "And she will think of you when
she sees the melon."</p>

<p>This amused the Ontario man, who shook
hands with Oisette and asked her to help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pick out something for his little girl. Finally,
after much looking, a pair of red slippers with
bead work on the toes was purchased. Then
the stranger bought a very tiny straw basket,
which contained a thimble; the latter just fitted
Oisette's finger, and she was made very happy
when he told her she was to keep it.</p>

<p>She made one of her deep curtsies, as the
nuns had taught her, and said softly, "Merci
bien, Monsieur."</p>

<p>That phrase amused the giver so much that
he took out his note book and wrote it down,
and he asked her to spell it for him, and kept
saying it over and over. "I'll tell my little
girl," he said, "that these were your very
words!"</p>

<p>Oisette showed her father the thimble and
whispered to him, "I shall make him a quilt!"
Her father laughed and repeated her saying
to the stranger, who declared that the very
next time he visited Montreal he would drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
out to the melon farm and see how the quilt
was coming on.</p>

<p>At last Oisette was ready to go to bed. It
was quite late now, but Quebec has a long
twilight in summertime, and from out the portholes
she could see the little villages along the
shore.</p>

<p>There was always a fine big church and a
good-sized convent, and clustered about these
were such tiny houses.</p>

<p>Finally, she fell asleep and dreamed that
the big churches were large hens and the little
cottages were chickens cared for by the very
big hens on the hill! And sometimes they
seemed to be all racing along the river's edge
together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE CITY OF QUEBEC</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> big steamer <i>Richelîeu</i> was moored at
the docks below the historic city of Quebec at
seven o'clock the next morning. Tourists were
allowed to remain in their staterooms until
eight o'clock if they chose and breakfast was
furnished on board. But Monsieur Tremblent
and Oisette were early risers and were among
the first to walk down the gangplank, attend
to their luggage and depart for the upper town,
where Grandmother Tremblent would have a
good breakfast of bacon and eggs ready for
her guests.</p>

<p>They did not drive up the steep hills in a
calêche, nor did they take the trolley, for Monsieur
Tremblent knew of a short cut; he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
reach his mother's home more readily by walking
one block in the lower town and then taking
an elevator, which runs right up the side
of the cliff and deposits its passengers on the
Terrace, where the beautiful Château Frontenac
stands.</p>

<p>Already Oisette felt as though she were walking
in the pages of history: for she knew well
the story of Samuel de Champlain, who had
founded this city so long ago. How he made
friends with the Algonquins and listened to
their stories of rivers and lakes and boundless
forests, and how with them as allies he led the
French in many wars against the Iroquois, the
most bloodthirsty of all Indian tribes; how
he bore the welfare of his colony upon his heart
to the very end, dying upon Christmas Day in
1635. He was buried close beside Fort St. Louis,
which is now the site of the beautiful
hotel, the Château Frontenac. This hostelry
often shelters nowadays ten times the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of people who made up the population of
New France, as Canada was called in the days
when it was governed by the brave Champlain.</p>

<p>Think of it! At that date six white children
represented young Canada, and Madame
de Champlain had scarcely any companions of
her own sex, save the three serving women
who had come with her from France.</p>

<p>When the elevator deposited Monsieur
Tremblent and Oisette Mary at the top of the
cliff, a short flight of steps brought them to
the Champlain monument, and here they paused
to get the wonderful view of the St. Lawrence
as it widens to the sea. Here Monsieur
Tremblent had a fine opportunity to point out
to his little girl many things of interest; on the
opposite shore was Levis, and from there one
gets a trolley along the river bank to the station
where one can see the wonderful new bridge,
which has the largest span in the world, and
which crosses the river at such a height that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
largest boats from over the ocean can sail beneath
it.</p>

<p>The tin roof and spire of a great church rises
on that bank also. It is the parish church of
St. Romauld; this church contains very lovely
mural paintings done by an Old World artist
some seventy-five years ago. A wealthy priest
spent all the money left by his mother's estate
in importing a young artist who had just won
a grand prize in Paris, and entertained him as
his guest for three years, until the work was
done, and his paintings are growing more mellow
and beautiful as the years pass. Monsieur
Tremblent had, as a small boy, been an acolyte
in that very church, and so little Oisette gazed
with rapture at the roof shining like a diamond
in the morning sunshine.</p>

<p>Goodness knows she was hungry when Madame
Tremblent's house, situated on the Grand
Alley, was reached; she found that her grandmother,
whom she had not seen for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
years, had grown smaller and thinner and wore
a black lace cap on her head, but that her eyes
were as bright as ever, and she had such a
happy contented smile of welcome for her son
and her granddaughter, whom she kissed on
both cheeks.</p>

<p>During the morning Oisette unpacked her
belongings, and became accustomed to the tall,
narrow, stone house, with its long flights of
narrow stairs, its tall, narrow windows; a house
where one had breakfast in the basement, with
windows on the street level, and received one's
visitors in a salon upstairs, a very grand room
with lofty ceilings and heavy cut glass chandeliers
that tinkled when any one walked
heavily in the room above.</p>

<p>To go to her bedroom she had to climb
another long flight of narrow stairs. But here,
again, the view was so wonderful that she forgot
to be homesick.</p>

<p>Her grandmother owned a marvelous big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
black cat with yellow eyes that answered to
the name of Napoleon, and also a dog, another
Carleau by the way, old and feeble now, sleeping
most of his time away, but he managed
to wag his tail slowly when he heard little
Oisette Mary's voice.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room, which was bright with
red curtains, flowered walls and much fancy
work of colored worsteds, there was a very
yellow canary in a very bright clean cage.</p>

<p>This bird had a very shrill little note that
made one's ears flutter, and he sang from the
time the church bell rang for early mass until
nightfall. Sometimes when he became too
shrill, Madame would take off her black apron
and hang it over the top of the cage and bid
the warbler to "marche a couché."</p>

<p>Oisette was very much amused at this camouflage.
"It is the daylight saving bill for the
pauvre oiseau," she explained to her father.</p>

<p>Monsieur Tremblent had much business to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
attend to on this trip, but he managed to have
Oisette go with him to the Falls of Montmorency,
where the river of that name takes a
leap of two hundred and fifty feet and joins
the St. Lawrence; and to visit the Duke of
Kent's house. The Duke of Kent was the
father of Queen Victoria of England, and about
the house are growing the most lovely old-fashioned
flowers. Then, one Sunday afternoon,
they took a long ride on the trolley and
visited the shrine of St. Anne de Beaupré.
Even before they left the tram car, Oisette
espied the stone basilica on the top of a very
pretty green hill, and as they entered the village
the chimes were ringing a processional and a
number of cripples thronged through the pillared
vestibule. This shrine is world famous
and sufferers have come one thousand miles
sometimes, to wait, like those of old in Bible
days, for the moving of the waters.</p>

<p>When they were finally allowed inside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
church Oisette gazed in awe at the pillars covered
with cast-off crutches, which faithful pilgrims
have left behind them as they have gone
forth healed. Then she walked slowly down
the church aisle with her father and saw the
great statue in gold of the good St. Anne herself,
and they were shown by the priest a sacred
relic. This is a small glass box and in it rests
a bone which the faithful believe is the wrist
bone of the dead Saint Anne herself. St. Anne
was, you see, the mother of the Blessed Virgin
Mary. Little Oisette knelt beside her father,
and each was allowed to kiss the glass which
held this relic. Doing this made them both
feel very happy and good.</p>

<p>The history of this shrine of St. Anne de
Beaupré goes back almost to the time of Samuel
de Champlain himself. A traditional account
of its foundation relates that some Breton
mariners being overtaken by a very violent
storm on the great St. Lawrence river knelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in their boat and prayed to the good St. Anne,
and vowed to her a sanctuary if she would
bring them safe to shore.</p>

<p>Their prayers were heard, the wind drove
them ashore. So, high on this hill, they raised
a little wooden chapel at Petit Cap and while
they were engaged in its construction one of
the men became the subject of the first miraculous
cure. He was badly crippled with rheumatism,
but as he worked on the building the
pains all left him. Presently other cures followed
and the shrine became renowned for
miracles. It has been known for two and a
half centuries. In that period it has been rebuilt
many times over. The shrine that Oisette
visited was built in 1886 and since that date
has had over one hundred thousand pilgrims
come every year to its healing altars.</p>

<p>Now, every one does not get cured. Some
who are brought there on beds stay week after
week, trying so hard to get help. Others are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
cured after just one visit, and go away so very
grateful and happy.</p>

<p>Oisette and her father went through a museum
at the rear of this "L'eglise de la bonne
St. Anne," and saw, carefully put away in glass
cases, the most wonderful jewelery&mdash;watches,
rings, bracelets&mdash;left behind by visitors who
had been helped, and who wanted to leave
some expression of their gratitude. Just what
good such baubles can do is a puzzling question.
But the wanting to give them is what counts,
isn't it?</p>

<p>One morning shortly before their return
home, Monsieur Tremblent had business at the
Château Frontenac, so he told Oisette if she
would wait for him on the Terrace, he would
afterward take her to see the Citadel, and then
they would have a view of the Plains of Abraham.</p>

<p>This Terrace, known as Dufferin Terrace, is
a lovely spot. There is a band concert about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ten-thirty every morning, and the people walk
up and down and laugh and chat. There are
always children playing out in this sunny spot,
watched over by nurse maids, or fond mammas.
There are always many tourists who come and
go from the Château, whose great doors open
on this historic spot. So, for a long time,
Oisette was contented to sit quietly on a bench
and hear the music and watch the crowds.
Mingling with the civilians were a good many
soldiers and blue jackets, for there were several
big ships at anchor in the harbor below.</p>

<p>Oisette didn't care for soldiers. You see,
she belonged to a peace-loving people, and to
her the greatest honor which could come to
her family would be to have a sister a nun,
or a brother a priest. But soldiers were men
who killed people, and she couldn't understand
why the throng on the terrace treated these
uniformed visitors with such respect.</p>

<p>Presently a little girl about her own age, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was dressed all in white, and carrying a white
and red parasol, came and sat down on her
bench and smiled at Oisette. "Hello! aren't
you the melon child?" she said. Oisette almost
fell off from the bench in surprise. But
she managed to nod her head. "Don't you
remember me? I knew you at once. We have
often gone out to your place after melons, but
they said you were away at a convent. Did
you run away from the convent? I am sure
I should." As she talked, the newcomer moved
along and held her parasol over Oisette's
head.</p>

<p>This kindly act warmed our little Quebec
cousin's heart. "Oh, no," she said, "I love
the convent and the good sisters, but I am
here visiting my grandmother."</p>

<p>"We are here," said the child, "with all
the family, to stay until my brother Reggy
sails away with his regiment. He is in camp
now at Valcartier and we ride out to see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
almost every day in the motor. I'll take you
if you like, some day."</p>

<p>French Canadian children are seldom rude,
and to say to this little Canadian girl who
adored soldiers, that she, Oisette, didn't like
them, would be awkward. At this moment
the band struck up "God save the King" to
mark the close of its morning concert; and the
little visitor closed her parasol with a snap,
stood at attention, and sang in her childish
treble:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"God save our gracious King,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Long live our noble King,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">God save our King.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Send him victorious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Happy and glorious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Long to reign over us.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">God save our King."</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>And when that was over, Oisette saw her
father approaching, so she hoped she would
not have to say that she didn't care much about
a ride to Valcartier. But little Miss Sage had
no idea of forsaking Oisette; she was too delighted
to find some one from home. So she
also greeted Mr. Tremblent with joy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="two girls and man in park" />
<div class="caption">"'ARE YOU GOING TO THE CITADEL IN ONE OF THOSE FUNNY CALÊCHE THINGS?'"</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh!" she said, "are you going to the
Citadel in one of those funny calêche things?
I am crazy to ride in one. I want to go in one
that has a yellow lining. Father says I would
look like a fried egg if I got into one of that
color." Monsieur Tremblent had always liked
this little girl when she visited his farm, so he
said: "If you will get permission from your
people, you shall ride with us this morning.
We will be three fried eggs."</p>

<p>While Monsieur Tremblent was making a
bargain with a calêche driver, little Helen Sage
was rushing about the Hotel Frontenac to find
some of her family and leave word with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
where she was going. At last, having found
all the bedrooms empty, she went to the desk
and wrote on a telegraph blank,&mdash;"Have gone
to the Citadel with the Melon family. Yours,
Helen." This she tucked under her mother's
bedroom door, and with a light heart skipped
out to join her little friend.</p>

<p>When you come to think of it, both these
little girls are little Quebec cousins, so it is
like having two heroines to a story! Oisette
knew well the early history of this wonderful
walled city. The French achievements, and
the names of the early Jesuits who suffered
and worked among the Indians. And Helen
Sage knew well the English side of the story:
how General Wolfe had climbed with his army
up the steep cliff and surprised Montcalm on
the Plains of Abraham and captured all of
Canada for the English. So Monsieur Tremblent
found it very interesting to listen to their
comments as they walked about inside the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Citadel. Helen knew the age and history
of the chain gate by which they entered.
She knew, too, which of the cannon had been
captured by the British at Bunker Hill. She
patted it and said: "It is the nicest cannon
here, isn't it? Father says, 'They have the hill
but we've got the cannon'!"</p>

<p>The result of this trip was very interesting.
Helen insisted on taking Oisette in their motor
the next morning all over the city of Quebec,
until she knew every bit of it externally. The
St. Louis Gate, named by Cardinal Richelieu
after his Royal Master, Louis XIV of France;
the Dufferin Gate, named from one of the
earlier Governor Generals of Canada, the Earl
of Dufferin, a most popular Irishman, who
helped blend the two nationalities in a wonderful
manner. A fascinating old curiosity shop
in an old house that was once the town house
of the Duke of Kent. She pointed out all
the tablets and the headquarters and the graves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the famous warriors of olden times. And,
in her turn, Oisette took Helen to see "Notre
Dame des Victories," the oldest church in this
country, built as Champlain directed. She
showed her the sign of the Golden Dog, and
read to her the inscription:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Je suis un chien qui ronge l'os<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">En le rongeant je prends mon repos,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Un jour viendra, qui n'est pas venu,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Que je mordrai qui m'aura mordu."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Translated this reads:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"I am the dog that gnaws his bone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I crouch and gnaw it all alone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A time will come, which is not yet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When I'll bite him by whom I'm bit."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is a tablet in gold on a plain bare
frontage. A dog gnawing a bone, the dog is
couchant (lying down), the bone is that of a
man's thigh-bone! Madame Tremblent had
told Oisette the interesting legend of Le Chien
D'or. It had its origin in the mercenary practices
of the last Intendant of Quebec under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
French régime&mdash;Intendant means a "City
Manager" of modern times. This wicked
one's name was Bigot. At a time when food
was very scarce indeed, and ships from France
bringing provisions to her colony were delayed
by wind and weather, Bigot gathered from poor
farmers all the grain and food stuffs he could
lay hands on and stored them in a building close
to his palace, and when the time was ripe and
a famine at hand he planned to sell back all
this food to the poor farmers who had raised
it, and to charge them a very big price. The
building where he stored all his goods became
known as La Frippone&mdash;"The cheat."</p>

<p>Now, among the merchants of Quebec at that
time was a man named Nicholas Jaquin, he
was rich and yet he was generous. He had
also a great warehouse on top of Mountain
hill, where the Quebec post office now stands.
He decided also to gather grain and foodstuffs
and to sell them at the lowest possible price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to the poor. Naturally, when the Intendant
found he was being undersold he was very
angry, he tried in every way to punish his
enemy, who over his door put this sign of the
Golden Dog, and the people all understood,
but were afraid to show too much sympathy,
as Bigot had been appointed by the King of
France.</p>

<p>Finally, the Intendant caused his enemy to
be slain in the streets of Quebec&mdash;the actual
assassin escaped for a time, but the murdered
man's son tracked him to far off Pondicherry
and struck his father's slayer down&mdash;the story
ends there.</p>

<p>They also visited the Ursuline Convent,
which has associations artistic and martial as
well as religious.</p>

<p>There is a votive lamp, lighted one hundred
and seventy years ago by two French officers,
who came to attend the ceremony of their two
sisters taking the veil, which means that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
young ladies became nuns and never lived outside
the convent walls again.</p>

<p>That lamp was to be kept burning forever&mdash;it
was out for a short time during the siege
of 1759; then it was relighted, and for well
over one hundred years was never dimmed.</p>

<p>This chapel also contained paintings sent over
from France for safe keeping at the time of
the French Revolution; and generally supposed
to be by great artists, such as Vandyke and
Campana; but even though they may be but
copies they are very well worth seeing.</p>

<p>The great General Montcalm was taken to
this convent to die, and was buried within the
precincts in a grave dug for him by a bursting
shell.</p>

<p>They also went to the Champlain market
and to the Convent of the Good Shepherd,
where the nuns dress always in white, and
never cease their prayers day nor night; every
six hours they change vigils, but always, always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
there are some of them there before the altar,
and one each side of the steps of the high
altar.</p>

<p>Grandmother Tremblent took a great interest
in this friendship, though she did not always
appear in person she directed many of
the excursions and answered all of Oisette's
questions.</p>

<p>The very first day Oisette arrived she had
asked about Richelieu, and almost every day
thereafter she had learned some new fact; she
had a good memory, and when she got back
home she would remember to tell her mother
about the great boat by which she had traveled,
and the picture, life-sized, of the Cardinal in
his red robes, who had been Minister of State
during the reign of King Louis XIV of France;
in fact Grandma had said he was the true
founder of the city of Quebec, for in 1627
he had revoked the Charter of De Caen, a
Huguenot merchant, and had organized a company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of one hundred associates, himself the
head. The colonists were to be given lands
and were to send all their furs to France and
France was to send food to them, so that they
would not have to do much farm work, but
made fur peltries their sole industry. It was
a niece of the great Cardinal Richelieu who
by her charity and her gifts founded some of
the early societies that existed in the city of
Quebec.</p>

<p>On the last day of Oisette's stay with her
grandmother, Helen Sage came for tea in this
quaint old house and admired Napoleon, the
canary and the fancy work. She was pleased,
too, with the quaint old furniture; a prie-dieu
chair in Oisette's bedroom particularly took
her fancy, the seat of this chair was very low,
not more than a foot from the ground, and
when lifted up revealed a little shelf for devotional
books, and a devout person could kneel
on this seat, facing the back of the chair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the top of the chair back was made flat and
wide to hold the open book.</p>

<p>In the dining-room was a beautiful mahogany
sideboard. "Oh, please, has it a history?"
asked Helen. "It is very ancient, my child,"
Madame answered. "In fact it was for years
stored in my grandfather's barn under some
hay, left there by an English officer who was
recalled home. He told my people that some
day he would come for it, but he never did, and
at last the old barn was to be torn down, so
my father gave the furniture to me."</p>

<p>There was also a glass cupboard, and desk,
but all that Madame was inclined to say about
them was that they were ancient&mdash;very ancient.</p>

<p>Some years ago, collectors of the antique
went thoroughly over the Province of Quebec,
and, where it was possible, purchased the best
examples of furniture and china and ornaments,
which had been brought from France by the
old Régime. The furniture of that day was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the most magnificent of all the French period.
A few examples of the work of Andrew Boule
found their way to the New World. He was
the King's Cabinet Maker and was a great
ebonist (a worker in ebony) inlaying his work,
gilding it, bronzing it&mdash;anything to make it
very splendid.</p>

<p>When tea was over, Grandmother Tremblent
told them the story of Madeleine Verchères.
Most of the historians and the novelists and
the poets of Canada have told and retold this
true tale of a little French Canadian girl of
fourteen, who was left one summer day with
her two brothers in the care of two soldiers
and one old man, while her father, the Seigneur
of Verchères, journeyed to Quebec.</p>

<p>Madeleine was out on a hillside gathering
wild strawberries when she heard a shot ring
out far down the valley and going to the top
of the hill her young eyes could see a band
of Iroquois riding swiftly over the plain toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
her father's fort. So she sent the two soldiers
to the block house to guard the women and
children of the estate, then she and her brothers
under cover of the dusk prepared dummies and
placed them behind the walls; then, to further
deceive the savages, she and her brothers patroled
the fort through the night and called
out "C'est bien," (All is well) so that the
Iroquois supposed the fort to be fully garrisoned,
and though they lingered about for a
time they did not dare attack.</p>

<p>The next morning her father returned, and
having learned that savages had been through
the valley, brought a party of soldiers with him,
expecting to find his home in ruins and his children
kidnapped; instead of that a tired, hungry
group of children greeted him with "C'est bien."</p>

<p>"So, you see, heroism was not confined to
the men alone," said Grandmother Tremblent.
"It was as it is now in modern days, the women
and even young girls who must be very brave."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>AT HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Finally</span> the day came when Oisette must
say good-by to Quebec, to grandmother, to ancient
Carleau, to Napoleon, to the yellow
canary, and then pay a last visit to the Terrace,
and say good-by to everything there. The
lovely view, the harbor boats, the statue of
Champlain, the beautiful Château Frontenac,
the band, and last, but not least, to the little
Sage girl, who had been so friendly to her.</p>

<p>All these things would soon be memories,
banked in her mind forever and ever. Monsieur
Tremblent and Oisette returned to Montreal
by rail, leaving the ancient walled city
soon after the noontime, and, journeying back
by a fast express, they reached the Place Viger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
railway station at six o'clock. Oisette proved
to be a very good traveler. She enjoyed the
view, she did not jump down from her seat
and tear about as some other children were
doing, but sat as her father had told her, and
counted or tried to, the trees as they flew past.
Sometimes she hummed softly her favorite
song:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Alouette, gentille Alouette, Alouette Je te plumerai,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Je te plumerai la tête, Je te plumerai la tête,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O Alouette, gentille Alouette, Alouette Je te plumerai."</span><br />
</p>

<p>A very pleasant surprise was when they
reached Montreal, and her father decided to
stop at the Place Viger Hotel for a meal before
they should take the trolley home. For, to
tell the truth, Oisette was very hungry indeed,
and so was her father.</p>

<p>Presently they were seated at a little table
out on a beautiful stone balcony, with pretty
striped awnings, potted plants, where there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
an orchestra of young ladies, all dressed in
white, who played delightful music. The
young lady at the piano kept smiling at Oisette.
It was a new experience for our little Quebec
cousin to have a full course dinner, served so
beautifully, and to have pink ice cream. Do
you know that ice cream is almost unknown in
a <i>Habitant</i> home? To be sure, French children
on the streets of Montreal have recently
acquired "the ice cream cone habit"; but vendors
of these sweets do not peddle their wares
out in the country. Oisette ate her dessert
slowly, her dark eyes followed the waiter as
he came and went, and now and then she would
glance over at the pianist.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished and they were
about to depart, to her great surprise, as they
passed near the piano, she heard a voice say,
"Bon soir, Oisette." Monsieur Tremblent
stopped, too, and shook hands with several of
the musicians; and Oisette gasped with surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for one of them was a cousin of Oisette's
mother. This orchestra was composed originally
of the members of one family. Five sisters
all trained by the nuns at the Sacred Heart
convent. In three years' time three of the sisters
had married and in each case the gap had
been filled by another pupil from this same
convent. They were still known as the five
sisters, and they still dressed exactly alike.
The one who had addressed Oisette was the
newest member of the little company. Only
the winter previous, at the convent, our little
Quebec cousin had played a duet with this Mlle.
Archambeau, and had done her part so well
that one of the nuns had said to her, "We
shall hear of our little Oisette on the concert
stage some day."</p>

<p>During the five minutes' rest accorded this
hotel orchestra these girls chatted like magpies
with the travelers, and sent messages to the
other members of the family, and said they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
hoped to get out to the melon farm some day
during the summer, and warned Oisette that
she must practice well on the piano, so that
she might some day play another duet with her
friend. Then the leader tapped his baton and
the voices ceased. But the cousin whispered
to Monsieur Tremblent: "We are going to
play 'The Rosary' now. You'll hear it as
you go down in the elevator."</p>

<p>When the-round-the-mountain car stopped
at Cote-des-Neiges that night, Monsieur Tremblent
and his little daughter alighted in the
dusk. They planned to surprise the household.
By crossing a meadow they approached the
house from the rear, and thought it would be
great fun to slip into the kitchen in the darkness
and leave their parcels, and then perhaps take
off their wraps. Oisette wondered if she might
manage to be discovered playing the piano.
The French Canadian loves a practical joke.</p>

<p>But it happened that some one in a motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
car passed the trolley in which the returned
travelers were journeying and the motor stopped
at the Tremblent farm about ten minutes before
the car was due, and, of course, the visitors
said whom they had seen. So Madame Tremblent
was ready with every room lighted, and
doors open, and Carleau was barking his head
off with excitement. The Dudley children were
tearing up the road, calling out, "Welcome
home!" On the stove was a big pot of pea
soup very hot, and on the table a big bunch of
field daisies, which the Dudleys had brought
early in the day. The big parlor lamp with
its red shade was lighted, which meant that it
was a very special occasion. Everybody gazed
in surprise at Oisette. She certainly had grown
a little taller, and she had a nice little manner,
which quite unconsciously she had acquired from
her grandmother. She forgot her shyness and
told them everything; from the time she had
left home until to-night when she had dined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at the Place Viger. No pea soup to-night,
thank you!</p>

<p>When at last she went to bed she gazed about
her own room with a new interest. The room
seemed smaller than she had thought it before,
but her pictures were so pretty. Nowhere had
she seen anything she liked as well as her Joan
of Arc banner wrought in silk. And there
was her own bedspread again, "the music of the
spheres," placed there in honor of her return.</p>

<p>"Chime, chime, chime, chime," rang the
church bell next morning. This was the bell
that had awakened our little Quebec cousin since
her birth. It sounded like an old friend, but
what a funny, feeble little bell it was after the
great tongues of the Quebec bells to which her
ears had become attuned.</p>

<p>Presently she heard the popping noise of firecrackers,
and Carleau barking madly in the
door yard: and she remembered that it was
July first, Dominion Day, a legal holiday all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
over the great country of Canada since 1867.
There would be no work done by the English,
and the trolley cars would bring numerous picnic
parties out to the countryside: and the Dudley
family were going to have great doings.
They had tried to tell her about it last night,
but her mind was still centered on Quebec.</p>

<p>By the time she had finished her breakfast
and was out in the morning sunshine, she gazed
with rapture at the Dudley's house. First of
all, the Union Jack was flying from a tall flag
staff, then the piazza was draped with red,
white, and blue; all the posts were wound with
red, and strings of Chinese lanterns were dancing
in the wind. She was told that there was
to be a children's party and she was to come
over to it, and they would like her to sing a
little song, as there was to be an entertainment
with the piazza for a stage. "You are to sing
in French. Our governess says that will make
a pleasing variety," explained the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is what I am to recite," demonstrated
Queenie Dudley, making a deep bow toward
Oisette:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Four fingers, a thumb, on each little hand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Make five jolly holidays all through the land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Victoria Day comes first, Dominion Day with its noise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then Thanksgiving and Christmas for girls and for boys,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then comes the New Year, brimful of good cheer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"But that is not suited to the summertime,"
objected her brother. "Father taught you
that for a Christmas party. You should have
learned a new one by this time."</p>

<p>"Bosh," said young Queenie, "you always
recite the same old thing, every party we have
or go to. You just make your bow and say:</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Speaking pieces. What's the use, I'd like to know?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Getting up before so many when it scares a fellow so!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Presently the piano was moved close to the
window, and the governess played some tunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and told the children to let her hear them sing.</p>

<p>They all joined in with a will, and sang
"The Maple Leaf, the Maple Leaf Forever";
and "Oh, Canada." When they had sung this
once through in English, she coaxed Oisette
Mary to repeat it alone in French, which she
did in a very winning manner. All day long
on Dominion Day these children romped together.
Oisette felt it was good to be home
with her dear little neighbors again; and when
at last, tired out after the party, she went home
and nestled down in her little bed she said an
extra little prayer of gratitude to Our Lady
for giving her such a happy first day home, and
then, tucking the rosary under her pillow, she
was soon asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oisette, like so many little French Canadian
girls who are convent trained, will become proficient
with her needle, she will play the piano,
she will always greet one with a pretty bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and a soft shy voice should one come to visit
her in this wonderful great land of Canada.</p>

<p>The Province of Quebec is not all French,
there are little girls with a Scotch accent, and
there are those with an English accent, and in
Ontario there are those very like American
children. But perhaps the French Canadian
child with her quaint little ways in her humble
home proves far the most interesting to the
traveler, and her simple life teaches every one
who knows her a lesson of obedience and contentment.</p>

<p>"Chime-Chime-Chime-Chime"&mdash;yes, the
story ends here, but the bells still call and call
little Oisette to awake, to come to prayers, to
attend vespers&mdash;"Chime-Chime-Chime-Chime."</p>

<p>Our little Quebec cousin bows her head when
she hears them "Chime-Chime-Chime-Chime"&mdash;and
life goes on.</p>
